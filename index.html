      You get promoted with a points system. Check your points in the Google Sheets roster. 
      Each battle you attend adds 50 points to your name. For the roster to know you attended a battle, stay for 1-2 minutes until audit is taken. You can ask your commander if audit has been taken yet.
      If you do well, you can earn an extra of 10-65 points.
      You can find the roster link

      schedule. The times shown in #95th-schedule auto-convert.

      Lines also typically have a rally higher than skirms, and skirms always have to rally 15 or less.

  <h2>Companies</h2>

  <section id="companies">

    <div>
      Companies in this regiment sort people by skill, and companies are used to help group and organize people in events. 
      For example, EU armywides used to have one company in-game for those in the fencible and line companies. 
      There would be another company in-game for lights and chosen men.
      You can only be in one company from either the 1st/2nd batallion, and 
      you can be in the NA expeditionary company alongside. All rankers are forced to be in a company.

    <br>

    <div class="bold">First Batallion</div>

    <div class="bold">Fencible Company</div>

    <div>
      This company is where you start. There is no requirement to join the fencibles. 
      It is the lowest ranking company of all the others.
    </div>
    
    <div class="bold">Line Company</div>

      This company is a rank above the fencibles, and usually fight in line alongside eachother. People in the line company or higher get early 
      access to the in-game code, and can join rally before it starts.
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="bold">Second Batallion</div>

    <div class="bold">Lights Company</div>

    <div>
      Requires an average of 50 kills in the roster. People in this company are typically considered elites. 
      It is more skilled than the line company. Drafts are rare.
    </div>

    <div class="bold">Chosen Men</div>

    <div>
      Requires an average of 55 kills in the roster. These are the most skilled, respected elite rankers in the 95th. 
      Drafts are extremely rare, and there are 30 maximum spots. Chosen men have their own uniform.

    <div class="bold">NA Expeditionary Company</div>

  <h2>Uniforms, Obtaining Unis in Barraux</h2>
  <button onclick="uni()">hide/show</button>

  <section id="uni">
    <div>
      The only way to get a uniform is from someone with commander permissions (or higher). You can typically only get uniforms in rally/battle, 
      and usually, you need to ask your commander for one.
    </div>
    <div>
      The 95th fencible uniform has a white coat. Chosen men uniforms have green pants. 
      The typical, common uniform is the green lights uniform with gray pants. There are uniforms for all ranks, 
      except for regulars and kingsmen - they use the private uniform.
    </div>
    <div>
      When joining Barraux, you are automatically given French 'tags.' If you aren't in any French groups, you will have no tags and no uniform. 
      To wear a British uniform, ask a commander/general/coordinator for BA tags, and you will wear the last British uniform you had equipped 
      (could be no uniform if you've never worn one).
