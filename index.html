  <h2>Promotion</h2>

  <section>
    <div>
      You get promoted with a points system. Check your points in the Google Sheets roster. 
      Each battle you attend adds 50 points to your name. For the roster to know you attended a battle, stay for 1-2 minutes until audit is taken. You can ask your commander if audit has been taken yet.
      If you do well, you can earn an extra of 10-65 points.
      You can find the roster link  
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ovCK0eD8FVL9dMHY9nY_gzM5q4LSsd53U_QxDDNQOrU/edit?gid=247858763#gid=247858763">here</a>. 
      Find your name and points in the "Roster" tab in the roster.

    <div>Promotions to fencible happen every week. Promotions to Regular and above happen every Monday (or sometimes Sunday for North Americans). They will appear in the bulletin.</div>

  <h2>Battles, Times, Lines vs. Skirmishers</h2>

  <section>
    <div>
      Rally is 30 minutes prior to battle start. It is also when the code is first released, and you receive training/practice during rally.
      Battle times observe daylight savings time. Below are battle times.

      What to expect at each battle. Lines play with muskets, and skirms (skirmishers) are equipped with rifles.
      Lines also typically have a rally higher than skirms, and skirms always have to rally 15 or less. 
      Below is the average schedule for the week.

  <h2>Uniforms, Obtaining Unis in Barraux</h2>

  <section>
    <div>
      The only way to get a uniform is from someone with officer permissions (or higher). You can typically only get uniforms in rally/battle, 
      and usually, you need to ask your commander for one.
    </div>
    <div>
      The 95th fencible uniform has a white coat. Chosen men uniforms have green pants. 
      The typical, common uniform is the green lights uniform with gray pants. There are uniforms for all ranks, 
      except for regulars and kingsmen - they use the private uniform.
    </div>
    <div>
      When joining Barraux, you are automatically given French 'tags.' If you aren't in any French groups, you will have no tags and no uniform. 
      To wear a British uniform, ask a officer/general/coordinator for BA tags, and you will wear the last British uniform you had equipped 
      (could be no uniform if you've never worn one).
